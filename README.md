# MERN-STACK


Hi, in this repository, I am adding all the notes of code related to what I am learning from past 12 weeks related to mern stack.
I learned a lot of new things, created some decent projects also. 

How is my notes are inclined
Week 1 - Js Foundation, async, await, promises, API creation
Week2 - Bash and terminal, filter map arrow functions
Week 3 - Nodejs Runtime, express basics/advance, MongoDb basics/ advance, postgres, middleware, zod, database and auth, DOM Manipulation
Week 4 - ReactJs
Week 5 - Reactjs, Projects on ReactJs(Todo application - Because of Todo application, I'm able to understand the cors, state management and retriving the data into front-end by hitting the backend. This is a very decent project only, but its a good start)
Week 6 - React Hook, useEffect,useMemo,useCallback, re-rendering, useCallbacks
Week 7 - ContextAPI, popDrilling, Recoil(its a nice thing to learn when you are working in Reactjs)
Week 8 - Tailwind Css/ Paytm Clone, I have created a paytm clone application where I can create a user, use that user to sign in, at the same time I can do transaction to the other users. I created a search bar also which can easilty filter all the users when you are sending the transaction
Week 9 - TypeScript, Generics, enums, imports and exports
Week 10- Postgres and Prisma - This week was interesting as I was able to learn a bit of docker also, with that I can create a image of postgres into the terminal using docker and I can use it to play with the postgres database. Prisma is a nice thing to learn- a good ORM which can make the database migration easy and it is easy to do CLI, which is a easy way to communicate with your database.
Week 11 - Serverless Fns, AWS Deployment - Again a very interesting week, but a jargon one also, as in this I tried to deploy the application on the clound so that I can host it easilily, used the cloudflare for the front-end and for the backend, I used the instances in the AWS. 
Weel 12- This  is current week, this week was more of recaps and at the same time, deep diving into the already learned things, like Advance Typescript API, Deploying npm packages, Monorepo, Actionable docker, SQL Relations and Joins, Prisma, Relationships in Prisma, Connetion pooling in serverless environments.
